        <h1>Beef biryani!</h1>
        <p>Beef Biryani is a rich and flavorful South Asian dish made with tender beef, aromatic basmati rice, and a
            blend of traditional spices.<br> It is known for its bold taste, unique layers, and festive aroma that makes
            it
            a favorite for gatherings and special occasions.
        </p>
        <h1>How we created??!!</h1>
        <p>We created this Beef Biryani by marinating the beef in spices, slow-cooking it until tender, and then
            layering it with fragrant basmati rice. <br> Each layer is infused with saffron and herbs to bring out the
            perfect balance of flavor and aroma.
